Use reinforcement learning to get the ball to follow a specific function given the volume of mic input.
  -> Display the current function (by sampling the network eg. between 0-1)
  -> Update display after ever stage of learning
  -> User rates the response to noise, this is where the learning happens

Can gamify this by having an option for users to try recreated some function using the reinforcement learning
  -> Also have a playground where its not gamified
